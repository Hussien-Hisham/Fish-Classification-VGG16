# Fish-Classification-VGG16
Deep learning project for classifying different types of fish species based on their images. The core of the project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model built on the VGG16 architecture.

Which has been fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in fish classification. Whether you're a marine biologist, a wildlife enthusiast, or just interested in image classification, this project provides a powerful tool for automatic fish species recognition.

# Key Features:

* Leverages the VGG16 architecture, a proven choice for image classification tasks.
* Offers a Jupyter notebook for model training and evaluation.
* Demonstrates transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques for optimal results.
* Utilizes visualization tools for analyzing model performance and prediction results.
* Allows you to experiment with hyperparameters and model configurations.
